	"The Newly Optimized Algorithm Summary"
     *  initially the disk head always starts at position 0, 
     *  The head moving to the position zero and start from zero to the last cylinder, 
     *  if the head starts at a position other than zero, we go to zero and then starts from there,
     *  we sort all the cylinders input block (the sequence array) in ascending order,
     *  Service the input request in front of head immediately till we reach to the end of the range,
     *  Return total_head_movements.
